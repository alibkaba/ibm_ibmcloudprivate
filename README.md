# Install IBM Cloud Private (ICP)
* I created this to allow me to deploy ICP fast.
* These scripts comes as-is with no promise of functionality or accuracy.  Feel free to change or improve it any way you see fit.
* I always refer back to the [ICP's official documentation](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSBS6K/product_welcome_cloud_private.html) for help.
